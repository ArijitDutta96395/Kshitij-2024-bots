### 2️⃣ **Droid Blitz – Amphibious Robot for Land & Water Operations**

Designed for the "Droid Blitz" event, this robot is engineered for seamless navigation across both land and water. Capable of performing multi-terrain tasks like block placement and package transfer, it is a testament to robotics versatility.

#### 🌊 Core Capabilities:
- 🏞 Amphibious Navigation: Operates in water and land zones
- 📦 Performs tasks like block bridging, object placement, and obstacle negotiation
- 🎮 Custom-built wireless controller with joysticks and buttons
- 🧠 Dual MCU system with Arduino Uno & Nano
- 🚗 Motors: Johnson 300 RPM & 10 RPM pick-and-place units
- 🔧 Enhanced with servo motors and water-resistant design
